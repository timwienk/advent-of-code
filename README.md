Advent of Code
==============

[Advent of Code][] is created by [Eric Wastl][]. It is an Advent
calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and
skill levels that can be solved in [any][] programming language you
like. People use them as a [speed contest][], [interview][] [prep][],
[company training][], [university][] [coursework][], [practice][]
[problems][], or to [challenge each other][].

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a
little programming knowledge and some [problem solving skills][] will
get you pretty far.

If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by
helping to [share][] it with others, or directly via [PayPal or
Coinbase][].

Advent of Code is a registered trademark in the United States.

This repository contains the code I used to solve the puzzles for the
day.
